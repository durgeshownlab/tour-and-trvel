Actually, the reason why so many people push themselves to the limit of exhaustion is simple \u2013 they just can not think of any interesting activities they can do, during their break time. So they end up working for 4-5 hours straight until their body offers them a painful reminder.<\/p>\n<p>If this sounds like you, here are some Counter-Intuitive Break ideas that help to restore your energy, sharpen your focus, boost productivity and avoid burnout at work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Share your break with a co-worker.<\/strong>\u00a0Alone, you might not always have the strength to pull yourself away from the computer, but if you have a friend taking breaks with you, it is much easier to stick with your break routine.
