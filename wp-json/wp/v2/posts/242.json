Not to mention the immense positive feelings and self-esteem that is part of every successful run. It\u2019s obviously no surprise why running is such an immensely popular exercise.<\/p>\n<h3>Set Goals<\/h3>\n<p>Establishing a goal for each run (even if it\u2019s just to not walk!) creates benchmarks of your progress and a sense of accomplishment. \u201cI used telephone poles when I was getting started,\u201d says Feller. \u201cEach time I ran, I told myself to make it to \u2018one more pole.\u2019\u201d Eventually, you might find yourself setting even crazier goals, says Elizabeth Maiuolo of Running and the City, \u201clike running over all of the NYC bridges or covering three different parks in one run.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Slow Down<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about pace at the beginning,\u201d says Amanda Loudin, the voice behind Miss Zippy. \u201cMany people get discouraged at first because they want to run \u2018fast.\u2019 So they go out and kill themselves, then feel dejected and discouraged.\u201d Coach Ryan Knapp of Out and Back emphasizes running at a conversational pace, meaning you should be able to talk on-the-go. While it may go against the \u201cNo pain. No gain.\u201d mentality, it \u201censures you are building your aerobic endurance and teaching your body to become more efficient, which is the key to running,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<h3>Buddy Up<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, it can be isolating to run alone, but we say there\u2019s plenty of road to share. \u201cAsk a friend you haven\u2019t seen in a while to run with you,\u201d says Jocelyn Bonneau, better known as Enthusiastic Runner. \u201cCatch up while running and the miles will fly by as you chat!\u201d Julie Curtis of ROJ Running adds that your date could also be a romantic one. \u201cStudies have shown couples who run together, stay together,\u201d she says. \u201cTake your crush out for a little jog or reignite passion in your long term relationship. That post-workout glow could lead to a few\u00a0<i>more<\/i>\u00a0calories burned \u2014 if you know what I\u2019m saying.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Treat\u00a0Yourself<\/h3>\n<p>We hate to sound shallow, but sometimes there\u2019s nothing like some new gear to get us going. \u201cA flashy training outfit will make me want to run faster and longer,\u201d admits Maiuolo. Michelle Roos of Pawsitively Delightful also abides by this approach. \u201cIf I have time (and money), I will buy either a new pair of shorts or a tank that will act as a reward for all of the hard work that I\u2019ve done up until then,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it\u2019s something I know I\u2019ll want to race in later, I can test it out!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Maybe running isn\u2019t for everyone, but you won\u2019t know until you try \u2014 and these are some ways to at least have fun while doing so. But according to Feller, the best tip we can offer is to power through. \u201cWhen you\u2019re getting started, the fight is as much mental as it is physical,\u201d she says. \u201cYou want running to be fun right away? I assure you, it\u2019s not going to be. But once you can find the mental strength to push through the initial tough ones, the runs that follow will truly be a blast.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Running improves your cardiovascular strength, lowers bad cholesterol and speeds up your metabolism.
