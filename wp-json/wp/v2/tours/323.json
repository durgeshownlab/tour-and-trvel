The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south, Sharjah in the northeast, and the Sultanate of Oman in the southeast. Hatta, a minor exclave of the emirate, is surrounded on three sides by Oman and by the emirates of Ajman (in the west) and Ras Al Khaimah (in the north). The Persian Gulf borders the western coast of the emirate. Dubai is positioned at 25.2697\u00b0N 55.3095\u00b0E and covers an area of 1,588 sq mi (4,110 km2), which represents a significant expansion beyond its initial 1,500 sq mi (3,900 km2) designation due to land reclamation from the sea.<\/p>\n<p>Dubai lies directly within the Arabian Desert. However, the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai&#8217;s landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns, while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country.[55] The sand consists mostly of crushed shell and coral and is fine, clean and white. East of the city, the salt-crusted coastal plains, known as sabkha, give way to a north-south running line of dunes. Farther east, the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with iron oxide.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":640,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","destinations":[71],"types":[33,38,42],"months":[45,50],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/tourpress.inspirythemes.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tours\/323"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/tourpress.inspirythemes.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tours"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/tourpress.inspirythemes.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/tour"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tourpress.inspirythemes.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tourpress.inspirythemes.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=323"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/tourpress.inspirythemes.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tours\/323\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tourpress.inspirythemes.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/640"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/tourpress.inspirythemes.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=323"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"tour-destination","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tourpress.inspirythemes.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/destinations?post=323"},{"taxonomy":"tour-type","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tourpress.inspirythemes.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types?post=323"},{"taxonomy":"tour-month","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/tourpress.inspirythemes.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/months?post=323"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
