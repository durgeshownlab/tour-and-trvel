										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An ideal time to write, comfortable digs, a great pen, and endless sheets of fabulous paper can make journaling more enjoyable. But if you think you can’t start journaling right this minute because you lack the right tools, you’re totally kidding yourself.</p>
<p>One of the most attractive elements of journaling is its simplicity. Journal writing has virtually no barriers to entry; if you can hold a pen, you can keep a journal. It’s open to all: young and old, rich and poor, homebodies and wanderers.</p>
<p>You can buy a composition book for a buck at any drug store. You only need twenty minutes a day, the same amount of time you’ll spend watching commercials during the evening news. And the most complicated piece of equipment required is a ballpoint pen. If you can’t figure out how to work one of those, you can use a pencil.</p>
<p>I chuckle to myself when I hear starry-eyed dreamers breathlessly declare, “I want to be a writer.” As though putting words on paper is like climbing Kilimanjaro or winning the lottery – not something attainable at 2:30 this afternoon. Mentally, I thrust a legal pad into their eager hands. “Here – write.” Presto! You’re a writer.</p>
<p>Writing makes you a writer. Just like running makes you a runner. You don’t stand around at cocktail parties saying, “I’d like to be a runner someday.” You strap on your Nikes and hit the pavement, preferably today.</p>
<p>You want to be a journal writer? Put down that mouse – right now – I’ll wait. Grab a piece of paper out of the recycling bin with at least one blank side, and put words on it for twenty minutes. Then come back to your computer.</p>
<h2>Keep it Simple</h2>
<p>Journal writing at its core is simple. You get some paper and a pen, you write a few pages about what’s going on. You do it again tomorrow. And the next day.</p>
<p>We humans are a curious bunch — we make things needlessly complicated. So if you feel yourself getting mired in whether or not you’re doing it right, what kind of journal to use, when you “should” write, or if the color of your pen will affect the outcome, take a breath and get back to basics.</p>
<p>Words, on a page. It’s really that simple.</p>
<h2>Do it Frequently</h2>
<p>Writing frequently supports the habit part of journaling. It allows you to witness the ebb and flow of your life. It gives you perspective that you won’t always feel this way — after all, you didn’t feel this way yesterday.</p>
<p>Daily journaling provides the most benefits and the best results. If you only write when you “need to,” you will forever be in crisis management. Your journal will be filled with dire consequences and high stakes. And you’ll continue to live in reactionary mode.</p>
<blockquote><p>The beauty of frequent journaling is that it helps you grow as a person, helps you recognize patterns in your life, and helps you gain perspective and control over your environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, just do your best. If you can’t make time for journaling <em>every</em> day, do it as often as you can. A couple times a week is better than not at all. And if you miss some time, just get back to it without beating yourself up.</p>
<p>Journaling should support you and make you feel good. It’s not another Task to be checked off your Action Item List or fodder for self-flagellation when you “fail.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to horizontal featured image post! The best way to demonstrate horizontal image with your blog post. This theme allows you to add images with flexible height so that you can express what you want.</p>
<h3>The Cocept Behind</h3>
<p>The overall concept is very simple, You just need an image with width greater than 1140px and of any height. When you upload the image as featured image from WordPress post editor, WordPress automatically crop the images to 1140px width and proportional height of no matter what value. This way if you upload an image that has less height and more width then you end up having a horizontal image as featured image.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let’s get started.</p>
<p>On the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of <em>None</em>, <em>Left</em>, <em>Right, </em>and <em>Center</em>. In addition, they also get the options of <em>Thumbnail</em>, <em>Medium</em>, <em>Large</em> &amp; <em>Fullsize</em>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-267 size-full" src="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="300" srcset="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg 580w, https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-580x300-1-300x155.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>The image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-509 size-full alignleft" src="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-150x150-1.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-150x150-1.jpg 150w, https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-150x150-1-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>.</p>
<p>As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we’ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it’s thang. Mission accomplished!</p>
<p>And now for a <em><strong>massively large image</strong></em>. It also has <em><strong>no alignment</strong></em>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-268 size-full" src="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="400" srcset="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg 1200w, https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-1200x4002-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-1200x4002-1-1024x341.jpg 1024w, https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-1200x4002-1-768x256.jpg 768w, https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-1200x4002-1-600x200.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-266 size-full alignright" src="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-300x200-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />And now we’re going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there… Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don’t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don’t let anyone else tell you differently.</p>
<p>In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah… Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.</p>
<p>And just when you thought we were done, we’re going to do them all over again with captions!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-267 size-full aligncenter" src="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="300" srcset="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg 580w, https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-580x300-1-300x155.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>The image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-266 size-full alignright" src="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-300x200-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />And now we’re going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there… Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don’t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don’t let anyone else tell you differently.</p>
<p>In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah… Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.</p>
<p>And just when you thought we were done, we’re going to do them all over again with captions!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-267 size-full aligncenter" src="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="300" srcset="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg 580w, https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-580x300-1-300x155.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>The image above happens to be <em><strong>centered</strong></em>. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-509 size-full" src="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-150x150-1.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-150x150-1.jpg 150w, https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-150x150-1-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Little bit caption</figcaption></figure>
<p>The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>.</p>
<p>As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we’ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it’s thang. Mission accomplished!</p>
<p>And now for a <em><strong>massively large image</strong></em>. It also has <em><strong>no alignment</strong></em>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_141" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-268 size-full" src="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="400" srcset="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-1200x4002-1.jpg 1200w, https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-1200x4002-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-1200x4002-1-1024x341.jpg 1024w, https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-1200x4002-1-768x256.jpg 768w, https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-1200x4002-1-600x200.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Massive image caption for your eyeballs.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.</p>
<figure id="attachment_139" class="wp-caption alignright"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-266 size-full" src="https://tourpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image-alignment-300x200-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Feels good to be right all the time.</figcaption></figure>
<p>And now we’re going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there… Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don’t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don’t let anyone else tell you differently.</p>
<p>In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah… Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.</p>
<p>And that’s a wrap, yo! You survived the tumultuous waters of alignment. Image alignment achievement unlocked!</p>
